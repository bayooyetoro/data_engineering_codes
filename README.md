This repo is a codebase for implementation of some data engineering concepts on:

1. Data Modelling and Compression
2. Cummulative Table Design and SCD.
3. Spark Engine Setup and Optimization Techniques
4. Real-time Analytics with Flink and Kafka
5. Analytical patterns: Aggregation, cumulation and window based architectures
6. Cardinality Reduction
7. Pipeline Maintenance and Data Quality Patterns

Designed towards learning at `DataExpert.io` summer training.

#### How to use this repo
• First step is to get `Docker Desktop` running and clone the repo.
• Then run `docker compose -d` command to get the `PostgreSQL` and its seeded data.
• The task requirements and its solution are in each folder 

Enyoy!
